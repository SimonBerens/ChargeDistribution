# Surface Charge Distribution Simulator
This simulation demonstrates how charge distributes on the surface of a conductor. The user draws the shape and adds charge to the conductor. These charges will be shown moving to their locations on the surface of the conductor such that the lowest possible total energy configuration is reached. 

#### Using the Simulator:
- Click and drag with your mouse to draw the shape you would like to simulate.
- Press "d" when the shape is done to connect the last point reached by your cursor to the initial drawing point.
- Press "q" with your cursor inside the border of the conductor to fill it with charges, which will then spread out to their respective positions on the surface of the shape.
- Utilize the sliders included to modify the properties of the simulation, such as charge per particle, mass per particle, and charge density.
- Press "c" when you have finished studying the shape to clear the screen.
- To use the presets, simply click the button corresponding to the shape you would like to see to create the shape, then press “q” with your cursor within the shape to add charges to it.

#### Helpful Tips:
- When drawing a concave shape, it is preferable to use a higher charge density because the area to surface area ratio is lower and the simulation will best demonstrate the behavior of the charges if more charges are added.
- When drawing a convex shape, it is preferable to use a lower charge density because the area to surface area ratio is higher and the simulation will best demonstrate the behavior of the charges if fewer charges are added. 
- It is essential that when 'q' is pressed to add charge that the mouse cursor is inside the walls of the shape. Otherwise, the charge will spawn outside of the shape.
- Towards the end of the simulation, there may be a charge slowly drifting within the conductor because simulation is already very close to equilibrium. To speed it up, adjust the sliders to raise energy conservation, reduce mass, or increase the charge (note that increasing the charge will change the potential energy of the system relative to before).
